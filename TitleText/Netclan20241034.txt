Also, we took sample data from a given big dataset and processed it quickly.The project successfully implemented a text classification solution using BERT-based models. The model achieved promising results in classifying people into organizational categories. The documentation outlines the steps from data loading to model training and evaluation, providing a comprehensive project overview.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sYlohokwi6e0ITZALvBJvrJkJdL79Rm2/view?usp=sharinghttps://www.loom.com/share/d1390fced221473ea78d360f5c61fac5Summarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.This solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
