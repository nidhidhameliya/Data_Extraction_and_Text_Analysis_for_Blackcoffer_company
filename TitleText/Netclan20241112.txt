We used python pandas techniques to control the use of memory which worked for some files and did not work for others. Provided more solutions using vaex ,dask module and datatables.Desired changes to the code and committing them to github.System specs requirement was the main issue during this project because the RAM available was too less and got used up quickly.Team viewer to use remote desktop which had higher specs would be sufficient enough to solve the problem.We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com© All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
