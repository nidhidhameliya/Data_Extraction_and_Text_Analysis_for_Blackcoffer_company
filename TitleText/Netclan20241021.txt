The EA will operate in real-time, leveraging both historical and live data to make buy/sell decisions. Data can be obtained via two primary methods:Additionally, the EA Robot will use an MQL5 script that defines the trading strategy, enabling automated trading on any MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. The core focus is to train an ML model for predictive trading, integrate data streams, and implement a scalable MQL5 strategy for execution.4. Backtesting and Performance Evaluation_________________________________________________________________________This approach ensures the development of a robust, data-driven EA Robot that integrates ML predictions with real-time trading platforms and APIs. It also guarantees flexibility for live trading on various currency pairs and adaptability to changing market conditions.This solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
