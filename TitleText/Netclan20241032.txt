The data analysis will be conducted using the OpenAI API, except for the mixed model, which will be handled manually. Then later user can do the simulation to get the insight of the dataset.Develop a web-based application using frameworks like React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Establish secure methods for database access and data handling. Initially, run statistical analyses using Python and update the interface with results including Mean AUC, Mean Accuracy, Mean Log-Likelihood, Coefficients with p-values, Intercept, BIC, AIC, Y_pred, Y_test, and X_test. Allow users to visualize the dataset with different charts, such as heatmaps, line charts, and actual vs. predicted values. Over time, automate these analyses by integrating Python scripts with the backend. Deploy the application on Google Cloud, ensuring the solution supports different user roles and permissions, with robust testing and scalable infrastructure. Provide features for users to perform simulations and gain insights based on the analysis results.Data Analysis Integration:Metrics and Results:Data Visualization:API Endpoints and Descriptions:1- Generating R-code through ChatGPT and Executing it in the Back-end:2-  Prompt Engineering:3- Mixed Model Handling:This is mainly used for healthcare field for data analysis enhancing decision-making efficiency and accuracy for users.https://test.aidprofit.comSummarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.This solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
